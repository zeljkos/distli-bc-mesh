Required Dependencies

  bulletproofs = "4.0"          # Range proofs
  curve25519-dalek = "4.0"      # Elliptic curve operations
  merlin = "3.0"                # Fiat-Shamir transformation
  rand_core = "0.6"             # Cryptographic RNG
  zeroize = "1.5"               # Secure memory cleanup

● Implementation Components & Effort Estimates

  1. Range Proofs for Billing (3-4 days)

  - Replace mock create_range_proof() with Bulletproofs implementation
  - Prove call duration (0-240 min) without revealing actual values
  - Integrate proof generation and verification

  2. IMSI Commitment Scheme (2-3 days)

  - Implement Pedersen commitments replacing hash-based mock
  - Add blinding factors management
  - Secure random number generation for commitments

  3. Settlement Aggregation Proofs (4-5 days)

  - Most complex component
  - Prove sum of sessions equals total without revealing individual amounts
  - Requires homomorphic commitment aggregation
  - Batch proof verification optimization

  4. Billing Correctness Proofs (3-4 days)

  - Prove rate × duration = amount in zero-knowledge
  - Implement multiplication proofs using Bulletproofs R1CS
  - Handle commitment arithmetic

  5. Key Management System (2-3 days)

  - Replace mock keys with real elliptic curve keypairs
  - Implement secure key storage/derivation
  - Add key rotation capabilities

  6. Performance Optimization (2-3 days)

  - Batch proof generation/verification
  - Parallel proof processing
  - Caching of common parameters

● Total Effort Summary

  Development Time: 16-22 days (single developer)
  - Core implementation: 14-19 days
  - Testing & debugging: 2-3 days

  Complexity Areas:
  1. High Complexity: Settlement aggregation proofs (requires deep understanding of homomorphic properties)
  2. Medium Complexity: Billing correctness proofs, range proofs
  3. Low Complexity: Basic commitments, key management

  Risk Factors:
  - Learning curve for Bulletproofs API (add 3-5 days if unfamiliar)
  - Performance tuning for production scale (may need additional optimization)
  - Integration with existing WebAssembly build (potential compatibility issues)

  Advantages of Your Current Code:
  - Clean architecture makes integration straightforward
  - Proper abstraction layers already in place
  - Mock functions map 1:1 to real implementations

  Recommended Approach:
  1. Start with simple Pedersen commitments (easiest win)
  2. Implement range proofs next (well-documented in Bulletproofs)
  3. Tackle billing proofs
  4. Finally implement settlement aggregation (most complex)

  The integration is moderately complex but your existing structure makes it manageable. The main challenge is cryptographic correctness rather
  than architectural changes.
