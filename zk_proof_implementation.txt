  Now, let me recapitulate what needs to be done for real ZK proof implementation with Bulletproofs:

  Current State (Mock/Demo)

  What we have now is a demonstration system that simulates ZK proofs:
  - Contract data is simply marked as "ENCRYPTED" or shown in plaintext based on role
  - No actual cryptographic proofs are generated or verified
  - IMSI commitments are just hex strings, not real cryptographic commitments
  - Settlement proofs are just labels saying "VERIFIED"

  Real ZK Proof Implementation with Bulletproofs

  1. Add Bulletproofs Dependency

  [dependencies]
  bulletproofs = "4.0"
  curve25519-dalek = "4.0"
  merlin = "3.0"  # For Fiat-Shamir transformation

  2. Core ZK Proof Components Needed

  A. Range Proofs for Billing

  // Prove call duration is within valid range (0-240 minutes)
  // without revealing actual duration
  use bulletproofs::{BulletproofGens, PedersenGens, RangeProof};

  fn create_duration_range_proof(duration: u64) -> RangeProof {
      // Prove: 0 <= duration <= 240
      // Without revealing the actual duration value
  }

  B. IMSI Commitment Scheme

  // Create cryptographic commitment to IMSI
  // that hides the actual subscriber identity
  fn create_imsi_commitment(imsi: &str) -> Commitment {
      // Use Pedersen commitment: C = g^m * h^r
      // where m = IMSI, r = random blinding factor
  }

  C. Settlement Aggregation Proof

  // Prove total settlement = sum of individual sessions
  // without revealing individual session amounts
  fn create_settlement_proof(
      sessions: Vec<SessionAmount>,
      total: u64
  ) -> AggregationProof {
      // Prove: total = session1 + session2 + ... + sessionN
      // Using homomorphic properties of commitments
  }

  D. Billing Correctness Proof

  // Prove billing calculation is correct
  // without revealing rate or duration
  fn create_billing_proof(
      rate_commitment: Commitment,
      duration_commitment: Commitment,
      amount_commitment: Commitment
  ) -> CorrectnessProof {
      // Prove: amount = rate * duration
      // Using zero-knowledge multiplication proof
  }

  3. Modified Contract Structure

  pub struct ZKContract {
      pub contract_id: Hash,
      pub participants_commitment: Commitment,  // Not plaintext
      pub rate_commitment: Commitment,          // Hidden rate
      pub settlement_proof: AggregationProof,   // Cryptographic proof
      pub public_parameters: PublicParams,      // For verification
  }

  pub struct ZKSession {
      pub imsi_commitment: Commitment,          // Not just hex string
      pub duration_range_proof: RangeProof,     // Actual proof
      pub billing_proof: CorrectnessProof,      // Actual proof
      pub amount_commitment: Commitment,        // Hidden amount
  }

  4. Verification Functions

  impl ZKContract {
      pub fn verify_settlement(&self) -> bool {
          // Cryptographically verify the settlement proof
          // Anyone can verify without learning private data
      }

      pub fn verify_billing(&self, session: &ZKSession) -> bool {
          // Verify billing calculation is correct
          // without learning rate, duration, or amount
      }
  }

  5. Key Management

  pub struct OperatorKeys {
      pub proving_key: ProvingKey,
      pub verifying_key: VerifyingKey,
      pub blinding_factors: Vec<Scalar>,  // For commitments
  }

  6. Integration Points

  The real ZK proof system would integrate at these points:

  1. Contract Creation: Generate commitments and initial proofs
  2. Session Recording: Create range proofs and billing proofs
  3. Settlement: Generate aggregation proof
  4. Verification: Anyone can verify proofs without private keys

  7. Example Real Implementation Flow

  // When T-Mobile creates a session with Orange
  let session = {
      // Create commitments
      let imsi_commitment = create_imsi_commitment("310260123456789");
      let duration_commitment = commit_to_value(60);  // 60 minutes

      // Create range proof that duration is valid
      let range_proof = prove_range(60, 0, 240);

      // Create billing proof
      let amount = rate * duration;
      let billing_proof = prove_multiplication(
          rate_commitment,
          duration_commitment,
          amount_commitment
      );

      ZKSession {
          imsi_commitment,
          duration_range_proof: range_proof,
          billing_proof,
          amount_commitment,
      }
  };

  // Anyone can verify without knowing values
  assert!(session.verify_range_proof());
  assert!(session.verify_billing_proof());

  8. Benefits of Real Implementation

  1. True Privacy: Actual cryptographic hiding of sensitive data
  2. Verifiable Computation: Mathematical proofs of correctness
  3. Non-repudiation: Cryptographic evidence of settlements
  4. Regulatory Compliance: Auditable without revealing customer data
  5. Trustless Verification: No need to trust operators

  9. Implementation Roadmap

  Phase 1: Add Bulletproofs library and basic range proofs
  Phase 2: Implement Pedersen commitments for values
  Phase 3: Add multiplication proofs for billing
  Phase 4: Implement aggregation proofs for settlements
  Phase 5: Add signature schemes for non-repudiation
  Phase 6: Performance optimization and batching

  This would transform the current mock system into a production-ready ZK proof system for private GSM roaming contracts, providing real cryptographic privacy and verifiability.
