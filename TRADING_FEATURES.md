# Smart Contracts & Trading Features

This update adds simple smart contract functionality with a basic bid-ask trading system to your blockchain. The messaging functionality remains completely intact.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Add the new files**:
   ```
   src/common/contracts.rs          # Smart contract engine
   src/common/blockchain.rs         # Updated blockchain with contracts  
   src/common/mod.rs               # Updated module exports
   public/index.html               # Updated browser interface with trading
   examples/trading_test.rs        # Test example
   ```

2. **Run the system**:
   ```bash
   # Start tracker (same as before)
   cargo run --bin tracker
   
   # Start enterprise validator (same as before)
   cargo run --bin enterprise-validator
   
   # Test trading functionality
   cargo run --example trading_test
   ```

3. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3030` and you'll see the new tabbed interface

## üéØ Features Added

### Browser Interface
- **üí¨ Messaging Tab**: Original messaging functionality (unchanged)
- **üìà Trading Tab**: Place buy/sell orders for BTC/ETH/ADA
- **üìä Order Book Tab**: View live order book and recent trades

### Smart Contract Engine (Rust)
- Simple VM for contract execution
- Trading contract with order matching
- Buy/sell/cancel operations
- Automatic trade execution when prices cross

### Trading Features
- **Order Book**: Bids sorted by price (highest first), asks by price (lowest first)
- **Price Discovery**: Trades execute at maker's price
- **Order Matching**: Automatic execution when buy price ‚â• sell price
- **Multi-Asset**: Support for BTC, ETH, ADA (easily extensible)

## üìã Usage Examples

### Browser Trading
1. Connect to network (same as before)
2. Switch to "Trading" tab
3. Place buy order: Select asset, enter quantity and price
4. Place sell order: Orders automatically match if prices cross
5. View order book and trades in real-time

### Rust API
```rust
use distli_mesh_bc::common::*;

let mut blockchain = Blockchain::new();

// Place buy order
let call = ContractCall {
    contract_id: "trading_contract".to_string(),
    function: "buy".to_string(),
    params: serde_json::json!({
        "asset": "BTC",
        "quantity": 1.0,
        "price": 50000.0
    }),
    caller: "alice".to_string(),
    gas_limit: 100,
};

let tx = blockchain.call_contract(call, "alice".to_string());
```

## üîß Architecture

### Transaction Types
The blockchain now supports three transaction types:

1. **Message**: Original text messaging
2. **ContractDeploy**: Deploy new smart contracts  
3. **ContractCall**: Execute contract functions

### Contract VM
- Simple execution engine for trading logic
- Gas metering for resource control
- Event system for trade notifications
- State persistence with blockchain

### Trading Contract
- Order book management (bids/asks)
- Trade matching engine
- Order cancellation
- Trade history tracking

## üéÆ What's Different

### For Users
- **Same P2P network**: Trading works over existing WebRTC mesh
- **Same mining**: Trade transactions get mined into blocks like messages
- **Same sync**: Trading state syncs automatically across peers

### For Developers  
- **Backward compatible**: All existing message code works unchanged
- **Simple extension**: Easy to add new contract types
- **Clean separation**: Trading logic isolated in contracts module

## üìä Trading Flow

1. **Place Order**: User submits buy/sell order via browser or API
2. **Contract Execution**: Trading contract processes order and attempts matching
3. **Trade Settlement**: Matched orders create trade records
4. **Broadcast**: Transaction broadcasted to P2P network like any other transaction
5. **Mining**: Orders and trades get mined into blocks
6. **Sync**: All peers update their local order books

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the System

### Add New Assets
```rust
// In browser interface, just add to select options:
<option value="DOT">DOT</option>

// Contract automatically handles any asset string
```

### Add New Contract Types
```rust
// In contracts.rs, add new contract type:
match contract.code.as_str() {
    "trading" => self.execute_trading_contract(contract, call),
    "lending" => self.execute_lending_contract(contract, call), // New!
    _ => // Unknown contract
}
```

### Custom Order Types
```rust
// Add new functions to trading contract:
"limit_order" => self.handle_limit_order(state, call, events),
"market_order" => self.handle_market_order(state, call, events),
"stop_loss" => self.handle_stop_loss(state, call, events),
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the example to see it in action:
```bash
cargo run --example trading_test
```

Expected output:
```
üöÄ Testing Smart Contract Trading System
‚úÖ Blockchain created with trading contract
üìà Test 1: Placing buy order
‚úÖ Buy order placed successfully
üìâ Test 2: Placing sell order  
‚úÖ Sell order placed successfully
   üí∞ Trade executed!
      üîÑ 0.5 BTC @ 50000 - bob -> alice
```

## üéØ Next Steps

The smart contract system is designed to be super simple and extensible. You can easily add:

- **Lending contracts**: Borrow/lend with interest
- **NFT contracts**: Create and trade unique tokens  
- **Governance contracts**: Voting and proposals
- **DeFi contracts**: Liquidity pools, swaps, etc.

The foundation is there - just add new contract types to the VM!
